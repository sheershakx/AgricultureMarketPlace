**AgriMarketPlace is a Marketplace for posting items and waiting for consumers to view item and place order same as e-commerce but specifically for Agriculture products focused for farming community and local people nearby them.**
# App flow includes 3 type of users: Admin ; Consumers ; Farmers .
**Admin :::**
Admin user is acted by any local governing body that governs farmers and market . They are accessed with user right to Create/(enable/disable) farmer(not allowed publicly to avoid spam), create Products and set its maximum rate.  
**Farmer :::**
Farmer users have options to post their product within criteria set by admin user, which eventually appears to feed of consumers. They can view Orders Received, Logs and their Farmer profile.  
**Consumer :::**
Consumer's front screen is all about feed that displays products posted by farmers , view its details and place orders with contact and delivery details. They can also view their order status and logs.  

**This is just a prototype version of concept app, hence a lots of tasks are need to be done. I ll get back to finish this off if it gains some attention to be developed as fully developed app.**

Project stopped in prototype until i need to make it  final product. But there are still few major functions to be coded apart from UI/UX and beautification.

Mandatory functions left to be completed:
**For admin user**
1. Create admin dashboard with simple button click menu to navigate to its pages

**For Farmer user**
1. Display all feed post in its dashboard.
2. Populate farmers profile through API with data
3.Create Detail view for onclick of farmer's MyOrder page to view order quantity ,user details and others.
4. Create Notifications(reusable activity with Consumer notification)

**For Consumer user**
1. Create MyOrders for Consumer and view their order status and processing
2. Create Log/notifications (reusable activity as with Farmers notification)
--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------
These are only functional mandatory features. The remaining task to be done involves UI/UX, many minor changes like UI components logics along with data parsing and post with API(few).

NOTE: This is just a note for myself to make myself aware where did i left, after i return to the project after long time.
